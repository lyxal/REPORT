# Recieve External Ping On ReporT (REPORT)

REPORT can be seen as SPAM ([Smokey Pings After Message](https://github.com/Charcoal-SE/userscripts/tree/master/spam)) but for situations where audio isn't avaliable.

Credit to the original SPAM userscript for serving as the basis for REPORT (I used the chat monitoring part of SPAM), and credit to Glorfindle's [Admin Flag Notifier](https://github.com/Glorfindel83/SE-Userscripts/tree/master/admin-flag-notifier) userscript for providing the basis for notification sending.
